# Named Entity Recognition

**Named-entity recognition** (NER) (also known as **entity identification**, **entity chunking** and **entity extraction**) is a subtask of **information extraction** that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

To evaluate the quality of a NER system's output, several measures have been defined. The usual measures are called **Precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score**. However, several issues remain in just how to calculate those values. State-of-the-art NER systems for English produce near-human performance. For example, the best system entering MUC-7 scored 93.39% of F-measure while human annotators scored 97.60% and 96.95%.
